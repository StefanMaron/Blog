This User Agreement (“Agreement”) is a legal contract between you (“you” or “Customer”) and Stefan Maron Consulting from which you are procuring Offerings (defined below) and governs your use of Offerings purchased through Azure Marketplace and AppSource Marketplace (collectively, “Marketplace”).

This Agreement is the parties’ entire agreement on this subject and merges and supersedes all related prior and contemporaneous agreements.

These licenses are solely for Customer’s own use and business purposes and are nontransferable except as expressly permitted under this Agreement or applicable law.

1.2 Duration of licenses

Licenses granted on a subscription basis expire at the end of the applicable subscription period set forth in the Order, unless renewed.

1.5 Reservation of Rights

Stefan Maron Consulting reserves all rights not expressly granted in this Agreement. Offerings are protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws and international treaties. No rights will be granted or implied by waiver or estoppel. Rights to access or use Offerings on a device do not give Customer any right to implement Stefan Maron Consulting’s patents or other intellectual property in the device itself or in any other software or devices.

3\. Confidentiality

3.1 Confidential Information

“Confidential Information” is non-public information that is designated “confidential” or that a reasonable person should understand is confidential, including, but not limited to, Customer Data, the terms of this Agreement, and Customer’s account authentication credentials. Confidential Information does not include information that: (1) becomes publicly available without a breach of a confidentiality obligation; (2) the receiving party received lawfully from another source without a confidentiality obligation; (3) is independently developed; or (4) is a comment or suggestion volunteered about the other party’s business, products or services.

3.2 Protection of Confidential Information

Each party will take reasonable steps to protect the other’s Confidential Information and will use the other party’s Confidential Information only for purposes of the parties’ business relationship. Neither party will disclose Confidential Information to third parties, except to its Representatives, and then only on a need-to-know basis under nondisclosure obligations at least as protective as this Agreement. Each party remains responsible for the use of Confidential Information by its Representatives and, in the event of discovery of any unauthorized use or disclosure, must promptly notify the other party.

3.3 Disclosure required by law

A party may disclose the other’s Confidential Information if required by law, but only after it notifies the other party (if legally permissible) to enable the other party to seek a protective order.

Customer must keep records relating to Offerings it and its Affiliates use or distribute. At Stefan Maron Consulting’s expense, Stefan Maron Consulting may verify Customer’s and its Affiliates’ compliance with this Agreement at any time upon 30 days’ notice.

If verification or self-audit reveals any unlicensed use, Customer must, within 30 days, order sufficient licenses to cover the period of its unlicensed use.
