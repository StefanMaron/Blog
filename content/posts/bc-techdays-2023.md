And yet another conference has come to an end. And again its this weird feeling I can not really describe. All I know is, I am already looking forward to meeting all of the community again in France for EMEA later this year!

It was again an awesome conference for may reasons: Good sessions, good networking, meeting all the friends again, having valuable talk with all those experts on their specific field. But this conference was also special for me since I finally jumped into the cold water and had my very first session. It was an incredible feeling being on stage and seeing so many people in the audience.

I wanted to thank everyone again who was there for joining and also for the nice feedback I got.

Also, this might be a good way to just collect some resources and links from the presentation:
