My name is Stefan Maroń and I am a passionate Dynamics Business Central developer. Dynamics NAV and Business Central is part of my life for around four years by now. I was always interested in connecting the NAV world to the outside world, building interfaces, migrating data and similar topics.

I’m also interested in understanding what is going on under the hood of NAV and Business Central.

I hope you enjoy reading what I have to say!
