The Spare Brained Licensing app is a gatekeeper, a virtual bouncer. It is built on the idea that an Extension should have an active License Key, and provides the hooks for Extensions to check if the subscription license is active.

You probably remember the glory days when we had direct access to data in Navision tables. But with the move to Cloud Business Central, we lost that ability. It's probably much safer and more correct, but what if we need to fix some data problem and we know what we're doing? We can write a routine that fixes that problem. But I suggest a better option, this Data Editor extension that allows you to change and delete information from any table in Business Central

The idea of the application is to read incoming JSON/XML files and generate AL basic objects from that information. You can paste JSON/XML direclty to page or application can also make HTTP requests with authorization depending on the settings.

Small tool designed to create a graph showing installed extensions and their respective dependencies, all from the Business Central environment in which the extension is running. In addition, it allows you to preview and download the generated text to easily add it to the client's documentation in Markdown format.

A library of many tools and small scripts, along with a framework to run them. Use it to measure the performance and impact on SQL for all sorts of prebuild tasks and add your own to measure them as well.
