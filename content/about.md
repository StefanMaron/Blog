My name is Stefan Maro≈Ñ and I am a passionate Dynamics Business Central developer. Dynamics NAV and Business Central is part of my life since 2016. I was always interested in connecting the NAV world to the outside world, building interfaces, migrating data and similar topics. 

Maybe you have come across one of my GitHub Repositories:

When I am not working on one of mine or on one of Microsofts Open Source repositories, I might be doing a Live Stream.
I started to Live stream my coding whenever I can and allowed to. I try to explain my entire thought process. Sometimes you just dont know you didnt know something until you hear it ;)

From the beginning, I was always facinated with living right on the edge of whats possible, pushing boundaries as much as possible.
Also for that reason I am working on Linux since the beginning of 2023 as my daily driver.

I am a Microsoft MVP for Business Central since 2024.

I hope you enjoy reading what I have to say!
