      <description>A few days ago I streamed how I try to upgrade a Business Central CRONOS Database just using docker:

Apart from a few throwbacks it went quite well, but better watch yourself ;)
However, I promised to publish the script I created so you don&amp;rsquo;t need to write it down from the video.

      <title>Speed up BC container creation</title>

      <description>This is probably going to be a short blog again and chances are high that you already know what I am going to share. But if your are like me and did not know this little trick, its going to save you, and maybe your team, quite some time!
Since I do not run my pipelines on DevOps but on GitLab I am quite happy to use the Run-ALPipeLine command. When you supply the -imageName parameter it behaves the same way like New-BCContainer does.</description>

      <title>Can I copy my container?</title>

      <description>I just stumbled over this twitter post from Steve
And I asked myself the same question already some time ago. And guess what, this is super easy ;)
Stop and Commit the container you want to copy You first need to stop your container you want to copy. If it is running of course ;)
Stop-BcContainer &amp;lt;ContainerToCopy&amp;gt; This should not take too long.
After that you can use the &amp;ldquo;Docker commit&amp;rdquo; command to save the current state of this container to a new image.</description>

      <title>Automated export objects from C/AL</title>

      <description>This time I have some tips on how to use GIT integration when developing in C/AL with docker. When used to AL development one of the first things to notice when going back to C/AL is, that you do not have any version control.
To solve this problem, I added a little bit of SQL code to the [Object] table as SQL Trigger. This trigger exports each edited object as TXT file to specified folder.</description>

      <title>How to: Fix problems with Docker DNS resolution</title>
      <link>https://stefanmaron.onrender.com/posts/how-to-fix-problems-with-docker-dns-resolution/</link>

      <description>Recently I discovered that my BC instance within a Docker container somehow can not access the internet. After some time I figured that the problem was the DNS resolution and I thought I might share two possible ways to resolve this problem with you!
How to check if you have the same problem You can check this by yourself if you enter you BC Container. (Note: You need to have the navcontainerhelper module installed)</description>
