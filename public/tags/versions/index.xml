      <description>Did you ever wonder what was changed in a cumulative update in Business Central? Sure, you can read the update notes from Microsoft and read the list of bug fixes they made. But I mean like, really know what was changed. Like, which line was changed on the customer table from between 2 versions?
Well, I did. For my own code I can always go to the repository and see all the code history.</description>
