      <description>This topic is probably as old as the RTC client. If you want to display a text field on a Page you will try for around two hours and then you will give up and maybe build a control addin to solve this.
In the web client this problem was not solved by now. We have fields with length up to 2048 but we are not able to display this.</description>
