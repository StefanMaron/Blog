      <description>Recently there was this question about how to do version numbering when working with AL Apps and automatic builds:
It started a discussion about when to update which part of the version number and how that is done. The discussion will be continued today (10th June 2021 9pm CEST) on Discord if you are interested to join/listen:
waldo on Twitter: &amp;ldquo;For whomever is interested - this Thursday, 9pm CEST, we&amp;rsquo;ll have a discussion on this topic (handling app versions) on the #msdyn365bc discord: https://t.</description>

      <description>A few days ago I streamed how I try to upgrade a Business Central CRONOS Database just using docker:

Apart from a few throwbacks it went quite well, but better watch yourself ;)
However, I promised to publish the script I created so you don&amp;rsquo;t need to write it down from the video.

      <description>You may know this problem: After a while working with feature branches your local git repository is a mess of many branches which don&amp;rsquo;t event exist anymore on your remote. (GitHub/GitLab/DevOps)
You could delete these local branches manually but if you are as lazy as I am, you might want to read on and just take my solution for this ;)
I wrote a short function in PowerShell which cleans up branches for me:</description>

      <title>Can I copy my container?</title>

      <description>I just stumbled over this twitter post from Steve
And I asked myself the same question already some time ago. And guess what, this is super easy ;)
Stop and Commit the container you want to copy You first need to stop your container you want to copy. If it is running of course ;)
Stop-BcContainer &amp;lt;ContainerToCopy&amp;gt; This should not take too long.
After that you can use the &amp;ldquo;Docker commit&amp;rdquo; command to save the current state of this container to a new image.</description>

      <description>Recently I discovered that my BC instance within a Docker container somehow can not access the internet. After some time I figured that the problem was the DNS resolution and I thought I might share two possible ways to resolve this problem with you!
How to check if you have the same problem You can check this by yourself if you enter you BC Container. (Note: You need to have the navcontainerhelper module installed)</description>
