      <description>Maybe you have read this in twitter already: I took over the AL Lint extension for VS Code from Marije Brummel. She searched quite some time already for someone and finally she found me :D
For now I did two things on this extension for now.
 I worked myself a little bit into extension development for VS Code and did a little bit of refactoring, updated some dependencies to new versions and removed checks which are now covered by the AL Code Cops.</description>
