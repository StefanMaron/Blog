      <description>I just joined the hype train and started to record AL learning videos!
Yes, I know what you might think now.
&amp;ldquo;Again? There are already enough people doing the same videos over and over again!&amp;rdquo;
But I have something different in mind. In this series of videos I want to share and show how I o stuff in AL. And maybe explain why I do it like this. My goal is to create videos as short as possible and focus only on a simple single task per video.</description>
