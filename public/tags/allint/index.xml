      <description>I just released a new version for the BusinessCentral.LinterCop.
This rule is similar to the PTE0004 from Microsoft which checks for your tables to have a TableData permission set. All the other permissions are not covered.
After some discussion and some thoughts I ended up also including the check for TableData in LC0015. If you dont want to have a double check for this, you can disable PTE0004.
More details can be found in the dedicated docs side for this rule:</description>

      <description>If you want to run pipelines with the LinterCop, you can use Run-ALPipeline and pass in the path to the LinterCop.dll via the parameter - CustomCops. But when running pipelines for various versions of BusinessCentral you might encounter errors like this:
Microsoft.Dynamics.Nav.CodeAnalysis, Version=8.2.8.24543, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=31bf3856ad364e35&#39;(,): warning : An instance of analyzer http://BusinessCentral.LinterCop.Design.Rule0012DoNotUseObjectIdInSystemFunctions cannot be created from C:\Agent\LinterCop\BusinessCentral.LinterCop.dll : Could not load file or assembly &#39;Microsoft.Dynamics.Nav.CodeAnalysis, Version=8.2.8.24543, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=31bf3856ad364e35&#39;.

      <description>In the last days, I managed to get some new updates for you released. Since this would be too much for a tweet, I will summarize here what changed, what will change in the next days (hopefully ðŸ™ƒ ), and what is planned for future updates.
What changed lately? Pipelines and automated builds The biggest change I did in the last weeks, was to introduce pipelines and automated builds on GitHub for the LinterCop.</description>

      <title>AL Lint v0.1.7: Code Metrics</title>
      <link>https://stefanmaron.onrender.com/posts/al-lint-v0-1-7-code-metrics/</link>

      <description>This morning I updated the code metrics calculation in AL Lint. Code metrics are meant to give you some comparable numbers on how complex your code is.
Why is this important information?
In general, if you install this extension, you aim for clean code. This is because code is written once but probably is read multiple times. And the easier it is to understand the more time you will save while reading your code.</description>

      <title>VS Code extension: AL Lint</title>

      <description>Maybe you have read this in twitter already: I took over the AL Lint extension for VS Code from Marije Brummel. She searched quite some time already for someone and finally she found me :D
For now I did two things on this extension for now.
 I worked myself a little bit into extension development for VS Code and did a little bit of refactoring, updated some dependencies to new versions and removed checks which are now covered by the AL Code Cops.</description>
